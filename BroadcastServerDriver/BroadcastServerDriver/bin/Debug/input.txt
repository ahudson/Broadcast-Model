ABSTRACT
With the advancement of computer networks more and more information is being shared. All across the world people are able to share information in many different ways. From social networking to Google search history, information is being created by the petabytes. This large scale sharing creates an even bigger problem: privacy. This paper will discuss different ways that social media can compromise privacy in regards to over-sharing personal information.
With the rate that very personal information is shared with social networks it is easy for anyone from third party application developers to sexual predators to gain privileged information. Cell phone locations can be tracked, even when they may not be on. With web 2.0 and the linking of social media to other websites, third party developers can access more than what people intend to share.
With these and other issues emerging, privacy has come to the forefront of social issues. Greater strides need to be taken by corporations  to protect people's privacy and there needs to be more widespread attempts by people themselves to protect their own information online as well.

1.	INTRODUCTION
For almost a decade social media and social networking has played a prominent part in how people communicate. It allows people to talk like they were in the same room when in reality they are thousands of miles apart.

Social media has evolved greatly from the early days. Now you can participate using mobile devices to communicate everywhere, and are able to share more and more kinds of information from location to video. This increased functionality has allowed for greater sharing of information.
This sharing raises one major concern: who can see this information. Many users would not wish for their intimate lives to be displayed openly to all the public, but at the same time developers want as much information as possible to be shared. This creates a major issue.
Some users have with sharing their information to the public, but wish to remain anonymous. Most social media services allow for the use of pseudonyms, but Google+ isn't one of them. 

2.	FACEBOOK AND PRIVACY SETTINGS
One of the main contributors of privacy reduction is Facebook. They have come under fire for confusing and always changing privacy settings. 
Originally the privacy policy was long and confusing. At just under 6,000 words it was long enough that one could assume most people never read the entire thing. Facebook creators argued  “There are always trade-offs between providing comprehensive and precise granular controls and offering simple tools that may be broad and blunt [...] We have tried to offer the most comprehensive and detailed controls and comprehensive and detailed information about them.”[1] While this may seem logical the complexity inhibited users from using the settings to the fullest. This situation was made worse when changes were made to change default settings to more public.
In December of 2010, Facebook made most of people's personal information public by default. Even though people were able to change it back to private, most of that information could have been saved by advertisers. In the spring of 2011 the situation grew worse with items linked to personal profiles being public without the ability to make it private.[6]
In an attempt to simplify  privacy, in August of 2011 Facebook changed their methods again to make it so people could change who could see what was posted on individual items. This wasn't brought around by the introduction of Google+. Facebook argues “ Company officials took pains to tell reporters that they had briefed privacy advocates on the changes — including those who have been critical of Facebook — and solicited their feedback.”[5] This change better informed users that the information they were sharing on the default privacy settings could be seen by anyone. This default privacy was still lose, but Facebook argues that they wish to have people sharing as much information as they can rather than not sharing any at all.[5]
Other issues still remained however. User's location when shared was still considered public, so users had no control over who was able to see this information. 
One could ask, why this would be a problem?  Users now know that what they are sharing can be seen by anyone, and if they have issues with it they can just change the settings. With the default privacy still set as public, less informed users will still share more information than intended, as well as the continued issue of location. 
3.	GOOGLE+ AND PSEUDONYMS
Google's social networking addition, Google+, launched in early 2011. It was intended to rival Facebook as the largest social networking web service, and at the very least give users a decent alternative. 
One focus of Google+ is increased awareness and use of privacy control. Google+ gives users the ability to decide who gets what information, from personal profile information to location. Google+ still tracks user's information through the use of cookies by default, it is possible to opt out of this service. While this is gives users greater privacy than what Facebook allows,  it takes away one aspect of privacy that is found generally everywhere online: anonymity.
 Unlike other social networking web services, Google+ does not allow the use of pseudonyms and requires a “real” name. This affects people who want to retain some forms of anonymity to companies who wish to participate in the service. “There’s a very simple business reason why Google cares if they have your real name. It means it’s possible to cross-relate your account with your buying behavior with their partners, who might be banks, retailers, supermarkets, hospitals, airlines. To connect with your use of cell phones that might be running their mobile operating system. To provide identity in a commerce-ready way. And to give them information about what you do on the Internet, without obfuscation of pseudonyms.”[4]
Yes the use of a pseudonym would decrease the effectiveness of the overall Google service, but many users do not wish to use this. They just want a simple social networking website, and preventing the use of non-”real” names would prevent some people from using it.
4.	MOBILE DEVICES AND THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS
Social Media is not just limited to social networking sites. Today many websites have web 2.0 plug ins, which allow people to share many kinds of information to social media services such as Facebook and Google+. These third party applications can pose a serious risk in terms of consumer privacy if mishandled, and there have been situations where that has occurred.
Amazon has launched had a social media service with their Kindle device, called public notes for several months. This service allows users to link their Kindle profile to their Facebook and Twitter profile and allows the spread of information between the two services. At the start the links were manual, you would have to allow your friends or followers to see your profile, but this has changed.  “As a convenience, whenever a Facebook friend starts to use kindle.amazon.com, or you become friends on Facebook with someone who already uses kindle.amazon.com, we’ll make sure that you follow them here too.”[2] Amazon calls this change “a convenience”, but it could be seen more as a privacy issue. Users may not know that by default they share information that they may not have intended.
Another type of information that is shared more often recently is geographic location. Most smart phones have some form of GPS, and many social media services take advantage of this software. Services such as FourSquare revolutionized it, while Facebook and others have recently come to use it often. This use has come under fire from lawmakers due to privacy concerns.
Senator Al Franken introduced a bill to require third party applications to request user consent for any information sharing regarding physical location. His reasoning was, “After listening to expert testimony at the hearing I chaired last month on mobile technology and privacy, and hearing from anti-domestic-violence groups in Minnesota who said this kind of technology can be exploited by abusers, I concluded that our laws do too little to protect information on our mobile devices .”[3]
If lawmakers do not believe that  consumers are not well educated about the risks of using such services this shows how serious the problem is. 
Users need to be more informed into what third party applications do with their information. Whether that information is made public, sold to advertisers, or just kept in a large database till the end of time. Without this knowledge users will not be able to make informed decisions about their privacy regarding third party applications.
5.	CONCLUSION
Privacy remains a major concern with regards to information sharing with social media. From general information sharing, to location, to pseudonyms and third party apps there are many areas where users are still not well informed to what the privacy policy is, and what their information is used for. There are several ways that this issue can be resolved, from legal action to creating laws to force third  party developers to divulge when the user's information is being taken, to general discussion with users about what the general privacy policy is and how to change different privacy settings. Regardless of how this issue is resolved, with the evolution of technology more privacy concerns will emerge.
